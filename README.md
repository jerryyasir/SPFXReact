# SPFXReact
This Repository is used to store for some basic examples SharePoint Framework Development.  These include some early builds of web parts that I migrated for a customer that were previously developed using SharePoint Server side apps.  These can be used as starting point for building complex list management.  

## SPFX-SharePoint
This folder is 95% functional working example of Crud Operation using a Grid like functionality.  It has some example of using Div based Grid, Bootstrap and sp-dialog.  It is not a 100% solution for great getting start.

Other two folders are some sample stuff only.
