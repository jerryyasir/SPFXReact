# SPFXReact
This Repository is used to store for some basic examples SharePoint Framework Development.  These include some early builds of web parts that I migrated for a customer that were previously developed using SharePoint Server side apps.  These can be used as starting point for building complex list management.  

## SPFX-SharePoint is a fully functional working example of Crud Operation using a Grid like functionality.
